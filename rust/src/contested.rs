//! The contested reading. A contested reading takes a
//! collection of recorded review inputs in the census form
//! and states, per set, the flags of the set that are
//! contested under CK-9 and the counts of the collection,
//! so which flags are contested, in which sets, stands as
//! figures rather than being read out of one set review at
//! a time. The loader validates each entry through the
//! shared set entry validation and each member through the
//! change set loader, the flags and verdicts come from the
//! set review, and whether a flag is contested comes from
//! the helper of CK-9, so the reading holds no second
//! flagging, judging, or contesting logic of its own. The
//! obligations this module carries are CK-17 and CK-18 in
//! CONTRACT.md, in the Round 8 section.
