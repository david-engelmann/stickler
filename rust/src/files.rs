//! The file reading. A file reading takes a collection
//! of recorded review inputs in the census form and
//! states, per file standing in the collection, every
//! flag of the collection standing on that file and the
//! counts of the collection, so which flags stand on
//! one file, across all sets, stands as one list rather
//! than being read out of one set review at a time. It
//! exists for the same recorded inputs as the census,
//! over the same collection loading whole. The loader
//! validates each entry through the shared set entry
//! validation and each member through the change set
//! loader, the flags and verdicts come from the set
//! review, and whether a flag is contested comes from
//! the helper of CK-9, so the reading holds no second
//! flagging, judging, or contesting logic of its own.
//! The obligations this module carries are CK-21 and
//! CK-22 in CONTRACT.md, in the Round 10 section.
