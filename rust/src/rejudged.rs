//! The rejudged ledger. A rejudged reading takes two
//! recorded sets, the first asking and the second asking of
//! one collection of review inputs, and states per input
//! standing in both sets the judgement each set reads over
//! it and whether the judgement held or changed between the
//! askings. The loader validates each member through the
//! change set loader, the flags and verdicts come from the
//! set review, and the judgements come from the outcome
//! helper of CK-8, so the ledger holds no second flagging
//! or judging logic of its own. The obligations this module
//! carries are CK-13 and CK-14 in CONTRACT.md, in the
//! Round 6 section.
