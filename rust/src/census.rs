//! The judging census. A census reads a collection of
//! recorded review inputs together and states, per set and in
//! total, the counts the standing set review paths produce.
//! The loader validates each member through the change set
//! loader, and the tally sums what the set review and the
//! outcome helpers return, holding no second flagging,
//! judging, or outcome logic. The obligations this module
//! carries are CK-11 and CK-12 in CONTRACT.md, in the Round 5
//! section.
