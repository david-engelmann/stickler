//! The pattern reading. A pattern reading takes a
//! collection of recorded review inputs in the census form
//! and states, per borderline pattern of CK-7, every flag
//! of the collection standing under that pattern and the
//! counts of the collection, so which flags stand under
//! one rule, across all sets, stands as one list rather
//! than being summed out of the census or read out of one
//! set review at a time. The loader validates each entry
//! through the shared set entry validation and each member
//! through the change set loader, the flags and verdicts
//! come from the set review, and whether a flag is
//! contested comes from the helper of CK-9, so the reading
//! holds no second flagging, judging, or contesting logic
//! of its own. The obligations this module carries are
//! CK-19 and CK-20 in CONTRACT.md, in the Round 9 section.
