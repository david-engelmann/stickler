//! A small JSON value module with the semantics of the Python
//! json module wherever the loaders' behaviour depends on them.
//!
//! The semantics were probed against Python 3.12 on this machine,
//! and the probes stand in the unit tests below and in the port
//! gate report.
//!
//! A duplicate object key keeps the last value, standing at the
//! position of its first key, as a Python dict holds it. A number
//! is classified from its raw literal. An integer literal is held
//! exactly as a big integer, and an integer literal of more than
//! 4300 digits is refused, as the Python int conversion refuses
//! it. A literal holding a point or an exponent is a float, read
//! with the correctly rounded conversion both runtimes share, so
//! a literal that overflows reads as an infinity and one that
//! underflows reads as a zero. The three constant spellings the
//! Python reader accepts, NaN, Infinity, and minus Infinity, read
//! as those floats. A string is held as a sequence of UTF-16 code
//! units, so an unpaired surrogate is representable, is detected,
//! and is refused by name by the loaders, as the Python loaders
//! refuse it. Nesting past the depth the Python reader reaches is
//! refused as its own error kind, because the Python surfaces
//! part on it. The render command lets the failure propagate and
//! the commands that read a change set or a collection name the
//! depth in their defect.
