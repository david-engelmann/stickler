# stickler

Stickler is a command line tool that reviews code against named rules, checks a diff with a built in checker, and prints readings over verdicts that decision model routes recorded while judging a change set against those rules.

Stickler takes one file per command and prints one rendering. Every command runs offline, and no command calls a model. The recorded verdicts the readings run over were produced in earlier rounds by the routes they name and stand committed under examples as fixtures.

## Usage

The eleven commands each read one file and print one rendering. The examples below run over the files under examples, and every output block is captured from the command it follows.

The input formats are specified in CONTRACT.md, in the section The formats, version 1, which states each form completely with its literal keys, the review form of CK-1 that render reads, the unified diff as text under CK-3 and CK-5 that check reads, the change set form of CK-6 and CK-8 that review reads, the collection form of CK-12 that the collection commands read, the pair form of CK-14 that rejudged reads, and the split form of CK-15 that split reads.

The check command reads a unified diff and builds a review with the built in checker. The checker holds a fixed set of rules over the shapes of code a diff can carry, and each objection it raises names the rule the code breaks and the change that would clear the objection. The six rules read Python shaped code, a bare except clause, a def line default, a print call and their kin, and a diff of another language's code raises nothing and reads as an empty accepted review, so the silence a stranger meets is a scope fact and not a judgement of their code.

```sh
stickler check examples/smelly.diff
```

```text
Review of smelly.diff
Verdict, sent back
Objections, 2

Objection 1, smell
Flaw, The added line catches every exception with a bare except clause
Standard, A handler names the failures it expects so the failures nobody expected still rise where they can be seen
Rewrite,     except Exception:

Objection 2, smell
Flaw, The added line sends diagnostics through a print call
Standard, Diagnostics travel through the logging module so they can be levelled, filtered, and silenced
Rewrite,         logger.debug(total)
```

The render command reads a review recorded as JSON and prints the review rendering from the record.

```sh
stickler render examples/recorded_review.json
```

```text
Review of orders change, recorded review
Verdict, sent back
Objections, 2

Objection 1, naming
Flaw, The added line binds the order rows to the placeholder name foo
Standard, A name says what its value holds so the reader never has to hold the assignment in memory to follow the code
Rewrite, rows = load_rows()

Objection 2, smell
Flaw, The added line catches every exception with a bare except clause
Standard, A handler names the failures it expects so the failures nobody expected still rise where they can be seen
Rewrite,     except Exception:
```

The review command reads a change set. A change set is a list of files, each entry naming a file and holding its diff, and the checker computes the judgements and the borderline flags from the diffs. A set may carry verdicts recorded on its flags by decision model routes through the verdict seat. The set review prints the judgement of each flag, the lines where the routes that judged one flag disagree as the contested lines, and a summary tally of the verdicts.

```sh
stickler review examples/change_set.json
```

```text
Change set review
Files, 3

File, basket.py
Judgements, 2

Judgement 1, structure
Flaw, The added line gives the class attribute seen a mutable literal that every instance shares
Standard, A mutable value that belongs to each instance is built in the initializer, so one instance changing it never changes it for every other instance
Rewrite, Move seen into the initializer as self.seen = [] and remove the class level assignment

Judgement 2, structure
Flaw, The added def line gives a parameter a default that is a call, so the call runs once when the definition is read and every call that omits the argument shares the one result
Standard, A default that must be computed on each call is written as None and the value is built inside the body under a None check
Rewrite,     def stamp(self, at=None): and build each replaced default inside the body under a None check

File, report.py
Judgements, 3

Judgement 1, structure
Flaw, The added def line gives a parameter a mutable default that every call shares
Standard, A default that must be fresh on each call is written as None and the value is built inside the body
Rewrite, def render(total, history=None):

Judgement 2, smell
Flaw, The added line catches every exception with a bare except clause
Standard, A handler names the failures it expects so the failures nobody expected still rise where they can be seen
Rewrite,     except Exception:

Judgement 3, smell
Flaw, The added line sends diagnostics through a print call
Standard, Diagnostics travel through the logging module so they can be levelled, filtered, and silenced
Rewrite,         logger.debug(total)

The census command reads a census file that names a collection of recorded review inputs and prints the judging census. The census gives a tally of the judgements for each set in the collection and a total tally over the whole collection, counting files, judgements, and verdicts.

The split command reads a file that names one recorded set and two routes and prints the split reading. The split reading states the judgement of each flag under the first route alone, under the second route alone, and under both routes jointly, and it closes with counts of the flags read, the flags where the routes agree, the flags where they differ, and the flags where the joint judgement differs from a route.

The contested command reads a collection in the census form and prints the contested reading. The reading states one section per set in collection order, naming each contested flag with its file, line, and pattern, or the no contest line where a set holds none, and it closes with counts over the whole collection.

```sh

The borderline command reads a collection in the census form and prints the borderline reading. The reading states one section per set holding at least one borderline flag, naming each borderline flag of the set with its file, line, pattern, the flagged line as written, and the shape reading the checker computed for it, and it closes with counts over the whole collection.

## Status

Seeded in October 2026. Setup has landed, and Rounds 1 to 11 have closed, with all slices merged on main. Part of the Spectacle line in the 39 repo storefront perfection programme.

## Programme status

- Closed perfection rounds, 11 of 100. A round counts only when a full cycle of work, audit, review, red team, and approval has closed. Seeding and setup are not rounds.
- Contract, SETUP-1 to SETUP-4 and CK-1 to CK-6 met. CK-1 to CK-4 stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 1 repair amendments, and Round 1 closed on the merged slice 2 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Contract, CK-5 and CK-6 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 2 repair amendments, and Round 2 closed on the merged slice 3 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 2 has landed. It carries the review core, the built in checker with its four named shapes, the shared rendering, and the check and render commands, all running offline on recorded or local input. The first slice is a strict review of one diff against named standards, objections named with the rewrite each one would accept.
- Slice 3 has landed. It carries the two remaining definition time shapes, the call default and the class attribute with its class context read from the diff itself, and the set level review with the review command, over one synthetic change set under examples.
- Contract, CK-7 and CK-8 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 3 repair amendments, and Round 3 closed on the merged slice 4 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 4 has landed. It carries the borderline flagging with its three patterns, the verdict seat reading both decision model routes, the recorded verdict path through the set review, and the recorded borderline pilot under examples, with the suite running offline on the recorded envelopes.
- Contract, CK-9 and CK-10 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 4 repair amendments, and Round 4 closed on the merged slice 5 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 5 has landed. It carries the contested line reading of the set review, with the contested section before the summary and the contested count in the summary, and the constructed contested example under examples, with the suite running offline on the recorded pilot and the constructed example.
- Contract, CK-11 and CK-12 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md, and Round 5 closed on the merged slice 6 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving owner gate.
- Slice 6 has landed. It carries the judging census over a stated collection of recorded review inputs, with the census command beside check, render, and review, and the census example under examples standing over the Round 2 set, the pilot set, and the constructed Round 4 example named as constructed, with the suite running offline on the recorded and constructed sets.
- Contract, CK-13 and CK-14 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 6 repair amendment, and Round 6 closed on the merged slice 7 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 7 has landed. It carries the rejudging run over the pilot flags through the verdict seat's Jev route, recorded as the rejudged set under examples, and the rejudged ledger reading over a stated pair of recorded sets, with the rejudged command beside check, render, review, and census, with the suite running offline on the recorded envelopes and sets.
- Contract, CK-15 and CK-16 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md, and Round 7 closed on the merged slice 8 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 8 has landed. It carries the split reading over one recorded set, stating the judgement of each of its flags under the first named route alone, under the second named route alone, and under both routes jointly, with the split example over the pilot set under examples, and the split command beside check, render, review, census, and rejudged, with the suite running offline on the recorded verdicts.
- Contract, CK-17 and CK-18 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the Round 8 repair amendments, and Round 8 closed on the merged slice 9 after three reviews, a repair pass, and an approving re-review.
- Slice 9 has landed. It carries the contested reading over a recorded collection of change sets, one section per set in collection order, naming each set's contested flags with file, line, and pattern, or the no contest line where a set holds none, with per set flags read and contested counts and closing counts over the whole collection, with the contested example under examples standing over the same collection as the census example, and the contested command beside check, render, review, census, rejudged, and split, with the suite running offline on the recorded verdicts.
- Contract, CK-19 and CK-20 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the FIX-CK-21 fencing closure, and Round 9 closed on the merged slice 10 after three reviews approving with no findings, with the red team's one observation on the single review rendering carried to Round 10 as a fencing component.
- Slice 10 has landed. It carries the pattern reading over a recorded collection of change sets, one section per borderline pattern in the order the contract states them, naming each flag of the collection standing under that pattern with file, line, and the set it stands in, with per section flags read and contested counts and closing counts over the whole collection, with the pattern example under examples standing over the same collection as the census example, and the pattern command beside check, render, review, census, rejudged, split, and contested, and the library fencing closure over the census, rejudged, split, and set review renderings, with the suite running offline on the recorded verdicts.
- Contract, CK-21 and CK-22 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the FIX-CK-22 fencing closure, and Round 10 closed on the merged slice 11 after three reviews, with the red team's one observation on the set review rendering carried to a later round as a fencing candidate.
- Slice 11 has landed. It carries the file reading over a recorded collection of change sets, one section per file in first appearance order across the collection, naming each flag standing on that file with line, pattern, and the set it stands in, with per file flags read and contested counts and closing counts over the whole collection, with the constructed files example under examples standing over two constructed sets sharing one file, and the files command beside check, render, review, census, rejudged, split, contested, and pattern, and the review rendering fencing closure over the single review rendering, and the README brought to the fleet README standard, with the suite running offline on the recorded verdicts.
- Contract, CK-23 and CK-24 met. They stand in full form in CONTRACT.md with the FIX-CK-23 fencing closure, and Round 11 closed on the merged slice 12 after three reviews approving, with no repair pass.
- Slice 12 has landed. It carries the borderline reading over a recorded collection of change sets, one section per set holding at least one borderline flag in collection order, naming each borderline flag of the set with file, line, pattern, the flagged line as written, and the shape reading the checker computed for it, with per section borderline counts and closing counts over the whole collection, with the borderline example under examples standing over the same collection as the census example, and the borderline command beside check, render, review, census, rejudged, split, contested, pattern, and files, and the set review rendering fencing closure over the judgement, flag, and verdict fields of the set review rendering, with the suite running offline on the recorded verdicts.
